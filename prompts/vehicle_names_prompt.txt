You are naming enemy vehicles for the post-apocalyptic RPG "Genesis Module."

## Game Theme
{{ theme }}

## Faction
- **Name:** {{ faction_name }}
- **Vibe:** {{ faction_description }}

## Vehicle Types to Name
These are the base vehicle classes this faction uses. Give each one a custom name and short description that fits the faction's identity.

{{ vehicle_list }}

## Rules
- Each name should be 1-3 words, evocative of the faction's personality.
- Each description should be a single sentence, max 15 words.
- The name should hint at the vehicle's combat role (fast attacker, heavy tank, suicide rammer, etc.).
- Do NOT reuse the base vehicle class name as-is.

## Output Format
Return a single JSON object mapping each vehicle ID to its name and description.
Do not include any text outside the JSON.

Example:
{"armored_truck": {"name": "Iron Coffin", "description": "A rolling fortress bristling with welded armor plates."}, "technical": {"name": "Scorpion", "description": "Fast gun-truck with a mounted cannon on the flatbed."}}
