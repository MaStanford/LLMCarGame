# INSTRUCTIONS
Based on all of the above, generate a new quest.
- The quest must adhere to the world's current theme: {{ theme }}
- The quest should be relevant to the current political landscape (especially the "vibe" of the factions) and the player's status.
- The quest's difficulty and rewards should be appropriate for a player who has completed a number of quests (as noted in the "PREVIOUSLY..." section).
- The quest must have a clear `name`, a `description` for the player, and some `dialog` for the quest giver.
- The quest must have one of the following objective types: `KillCountObjective`, `KillBossObjective`, `SurvivalObjective`, `DeliverPackageObjective`, or `DefendLocationObjective`.
- The `target_vehicle` for `KillBossObjective` objectives MUST be chosen from the `Enemy Vehicles` list in the **Available Entities** section of the game context.
- The `enemy_types` for `KillCountObjective` and `SurvivalObjective` objectives MUST be chosen from the `Enemy Vehicles` and `Characters` lists in the **Available Entities** section of the game context.
- Do NOT invent new entities. Use only the provided lists.
- If the quest is against a specific faction, include the `"target_faction"` key with that faction's ID.
- If the quest is against generic enemies (like local bandits) or is non-combat, set `"target_faction": null`.
- Provide a JSON object matching the format below exactly.
