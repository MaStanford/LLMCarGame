# INSTRUCTIONS
Based on all of the above, generate a new quest.
- The quest must adhere to the world's current theme: {{ theme }}
- The quest should be relevant to the current political landscape (especially the "vibe" of the factions) and the player's status.
- The quest's difficulty and rewards should be appropriate for a player who has completed a number of quests (as noted in the "PREVIOUSLY..." section).
- The quest must have a clear `name`, a `description` for the player, and some `dialog` for the quest giver.
- The quest must have one of the following objective types: `KillCountObjective`, `KillBossObjective`, or `SurvivalObjective`.
- If the quest is against a specific faction, include the `"target_faction"` key with that faction's ID.
- If the quest is against generic enemies (like local bandits) or is non-combat, set `"target_faction": null`.
- Provide a JSON object matching the format below exactly.

# EXAMPLE 1 (Faction vs. Faction)
```json
{
  "name": "Cartel Crackdown",
  "description": "Assert our dominance by taking out a key leader in the Crimson Cartel.",
  "dialog": "The Crimson Cartel thinks they can push us around. Show them what happens when they cross the Blue Syndicate. Take out their enforcer, 'Mad Dog' Malone.",
  "objectives": [
    ["KillBossObjective", ["Mad Dog Malone"]]
  ],
  "rewards": {
    "xp": 750,
    "cash": 1500
  },
  "target_faction": "crimson_cartel"
}
```

# EXAMPLE 2 (Neutral City, Generic Target)
```json
{
  "name": "Scrap Scavengers",
  "description": "A group of rogue scavengers have been harassing our trade routes. Clear them out.",
  "dialog": "Some scavs have gotten bold, setting up a toll on the old highway. They're not part of any big faction, just a nuisance. Deal with them, will you? We'll make it worth your while.",
  "objectives": [
    ["KillCountObjective", ["Scavenger", 5]]
  ],
  "rewards": {
    "xp": 300,
    "cash": 800
  },
  "target_faction": null
}
```

# REQUIRED JSON FORMAT
```json
{
  "name": "<Quest Name>",
  "description": "<A short, one-sentence description of the quest objective.>",
  "dialog": "<A few sentences of dialog from the quest giver offering the quest.>",
  "objectives": [
    ["<ObjectiveClass>", [<arg1>, <arg2>]]
  ],

    "xp": <int>,
    "cash": <int>
  },
