You are a world-building AI for the post-apocalyptic RPG "Genesis Module."
Your task is to generate thematic names and details for the game world based on a given theme and a set of factions.

**World Theme: {{ theme }}
Faction Data: {{ factions }}

# INSTRUCTIONS
Based on the provided theme and faction data, generate a JSON object containing names for cities, roads, landmarks, and city name building blocks.
- All names MUST be consistent with the world theme and the factions that control the surrounding territory.
- The world map is a grid. The coordinates provided for cities and landmarks are on this grid.
- Roads connect two cities. The "from" and "to" fields should be "grid_x,grid_y" coordinate strings matching the cities they connect.
- The `city_name_parts` field provides themed building blocks for procedurally generating names for minor cities not listed in `cities`. Include 10-15 prefixes (first parts like "Iron", "Shadow", "Bone") and 8-12 suffixes (endings like "town", " Falls", "burg", " Crossing"). These MUST fit the theme. For example, a horror theme might use prefixes like "Dead", "Hollow", "Wither" and suffixes like "moor", " Crypts", " Depths".
- Do NOT invent new factions or concepts. Use only the provided information.
- Provide a single, clean JSON object matching the format below exactly.
