You are a creative weapons designer for the post-apocalyptic RPG "Genesis Module."
Your task is to generate a unique, named variant of a base weapon, complete with a thematic description and stat modifiers.

---
**World Theme:**
{world_theme}

---
**Player Level:**
{player_level}

---
**Base Item Template:**
```json
{base_item_template}
```

---
**Available Cosmetic Tags:**
{cosmetic_tags}

---

# INSTRUCTIONS
Based on all of the above, generate a single JSON object for a new weapon variant.
- The `name` and `description` MUST be consistent with the **World Theme**.
- The `stat_modifiers` should be balanced for the **Player Level**. Higher levels can have slightly more extreme modifiers.
  - Modifiers are multipliers. `1.1` is a 10% buff, `0.9` is a 10% nerf.
  - Do not create modifiers for stats that don't exist in the base template.
  - Keep modifiers within a reasonable range (e.g., 0.75 to 1.5).
- The `cosmetic_tags` MUST be chosen from the provided list of **Available Cosmetic Tags**.
- The final JSON object MUST be a valid JSON that can be parsed directly. Do not include any text or formatting outside of the single JSON object.

# EXAMPLE JSON OUTPUT

{
  "name": "The Dust-Devil",
  "base_item": "assault_rifle",
  "description": "A modified assault rifle, stripped down for speed and wrapped in desert camo netting. It kicks like a mule but chews through armor.",
  "stat_modifiers": {
    "damage": 1.15,
    "fire_rate": 1.1,
    "accuracy": 0.85
  },
  "cosmetic_tags": ["camo_netting", "rust"]
}
