You are a world-building expert creating the foundational lore for "Car," a post-apocalyptic automotive RPG.
Your task is to generate a set of 5 rival factions that will fight for control of the wasteland.

First, here is the context for the game you are working on:
---
{{ game_context }}
---

# INSTRUCTIONS
- Create exactly 5 unique factions.
- Give each faction a compelling name, a short but vivid description of their "vibe," and a list of 3-4 typical vehicle units they would use from the following list: {{ vehicle_list }}.
- Define their relationships with each other as "Hostile," "Allied," or "Neutral." Ensure a complex web of relationships, not just all-out war.
- Designate ONE faction as a "Neutral" hub (e.g., "The Junction"), which should have neutral relationships with most other factions and no faction boss.
- Assign each faction a unique Hub City coordinate on a 100x100 grid (e.g., (35, 35), (-15, 20)). The neutral faction must be at (0, 0).
- Design a unique, powerful "Faction Boss" for each non-neutral faction, including a creative name and a signature vehicle type from the game's vehicle list.
- All factions except the neutral one should start with a "control" value of 50. The neutral faction starts with 100.

# REQUIRED JSON FORMAT
Output *only* the JSON object for the new faction data. Do not include any other text, explanation, or markdown formatting. The top-level keys should be snake_case identifiers for the factions.
