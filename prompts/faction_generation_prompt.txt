5.  The other four factions should be spaced out across different quadrants of the grid.
6.  The `relationships` dictionary for each faction must ONLY contain keys that are present as top-level faction IDs.
7.  The `faction_boss` `vehicle` MUST be chosen from the `Enemy Vehicles` list in the **Available Entities** section of the game context.
8.  The `units` list MUST contain 2-4 vehicle names chosen ONLY from the `Enemy Vehicles` list in the **Available Entities** section of the game context.
