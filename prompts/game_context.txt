This document outlines the core concepts, factions, and mechanics for "Car," a terminal-based, open-world, automotive RPG survival game.

## Core Gameplay Loop
Players are freelance mercenaries in a post-apocalyptic world dominated by warring vehicle-based factions. They drive between procedurally generated cities, taking on contracts (quests) to earn money, experience, and reputation. The primary gameplay involves vehicular combat, resource management (fuel, ammo, durability), and completing quests that directly impact the balance of power between factions.

## Faction Dossiers

There are three major factions vying for control:

1.  **The Vultures:**
    *   **Vibe:** Scrap-punk survivalists. They are masters of salvage and improvisation, favoring rugged, heavily armored vehicles bristling with makeshift weaponry. They are territorial, aggressive, and see value in anything that can be stripped for parts.
    *   **Goals:** Expand their scrap heaps and control the trade of salvaged goods. They believe that "might makes right" and respect only strength and utility.

2.  **The Desert Rats:**
    *   **Vibe:** Nomadic, speed-obsessed freedom fighters. They value agility and hit-and-run tactics, using fast, lightweight buggies and technicals. They operate under a loose code of honor and fight to remain independent from the other, more tyrannical factions.
    *   **Goals:** Maintain their freedom, control the open roads, and disrupt the supply lines of their rivals. They value speed, skill, and daring.

3.  **The Corporate Guard:**
    *   **Vibe:** Remnants of a pre-apocalypse corporate security force. They are organized, technologically advanced, and use well-maintained, high-tech energy weapons. They see themselves as the rightful heirs to the old world, seeking to impose order and control through superior firepower and strategy.
    *   **Goals:** Re-establish a centralized, authoritarian government under their control. They believe that order, discipline, and technology are the keys to rebuilding civilization.

## Key Mechanics

*   **Faction Control:** A score from 0-100 representing a faction's power. High control means better shops and safer territory. Low control means chaos and vulnerability. Player quests are the primary way to change this score.
*   **Quests:** Generated dynamically. The player is hired by one faction to perform a task that hurts a rival faction. This always involves a shift in Faction Control and player reputation.
*   **Quest Objectives:** Quests will have a clear objective, typically one of the following:
    *   `KILL_BOSS`: Hunt down and destroy a specific, powerful enemy vehicle.
    *   `DESTROY_CONVOY`: Ambush and destroy a group of weaker enemy vehicles.
    *   `SURVIVE_WAVE`: Survive an onslaught of enemies for a set amount of time.
*   **Reputation:** The player's personal standing with each faction. High reputation unlocks better opportunities. Low reputation can lead to being attacked on sight.
*   **Hub Cities:** Each faction has a central, static Hub City that serves as their capital. All other cities are procedurally generated, and their allegiance is determined by which Hub City is closest.
*   **Conquest:** A faction can be taken over. This requires the player to first reduce the target faction's Control score below 20, then accept a special "Decisive Battle" quest from a rival to destroy the target's Faction Boss.
