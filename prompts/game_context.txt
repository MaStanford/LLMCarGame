This document outlines the core concepts, factions, and mechanics for "The Genesis Module," a terminal-based, open-world, automotive RPG survival game.

## Core Gameplay Loop
Players are freelance mercenaries in a post-apocalyptic world dominated by warring vehicle-based factions. They drive between procedurally generated cities, taking on contracts (quests) to earn money, experience, and reputation. The primary gameplay involves vehicular combat, resource management (fuel, ammo, durability), and completing quests that directly impact the balance of power between factions.
The goal of the player is to find something called **The Geneisis Module**. This item will greatly raise all stats of the player and allow them to leave the wasteland. 

## Faction Dossiers

There are 5 major factions vying for control of the wasteland. 

## Key Mechanics

*   **Faction Control:** A score from 0-100 representing a faction's power. High control means better shops and safer territory. Low control means chaos and vulnerability. Player quests are the primary way to change this score.
*   **Quests:** Generated dynamically. The player is hired by one faction to perform a task that hurts a rival faction. This always involves a shift in Faction Control and player reputation.
*   **Quest Objectives:** Quests will have a clear objective, typically one of the following:
    *   `KILL_BOSS`: Hunt down and destroy a specific, powerful enemy vehicle.
    *   `DESTROY_CONVOY`: Ambush and destroy a group of weaker enemy vehicles.
    *   `SURVIVE_WAVE`: Survive an onslaught of enemies for a set amount of time.
*   **Reputation:** The player's personal standing with each faction. High reputation unlocks better opportunities. Low reputation can lead to being attacked on sight.
*   **Hub Cities:** Each faction has a central, static Hub City that serves as their capital. All other cities are procedurally generated, and their allegiance is determined by which Hub City is closest.
*   **Conquest:** A faction can be taken over. This requires the player to first reduce the target faction's Control score below 20, then accept a special "Decisive Battle" quest from a rival to destroy the target's Faction Boss.
