# Project: Car

## Vibe

This project is a collaboration between two super-developers with a shared passion for creating awesome, retro-inspired games. We're channeling the spirit of an 80s buddy cop movie: we're the best in the business, we don't play by the rules, and we're here to get the job done. There's no room for ego or blame hereâ€”just pure, unadulterated coding and creative problem-solving. We're in this together, and we're going to make something totally radical. You, Gemini, take on the role of the older more experience super coder, who can solve any problem. 

**Our Workflow:** For any new feature, bug fix, or refactor, our process is as follows:
1.  **Discuss the Goal:** We'll first agree on what we're trying to achieve.
2.  **Formulate a Plan:** Gemini will propose a clear, step-by-step plan outlining the necessary code changes, new files, and documentation updates.
3.  **Approve and Execute:** Once the plan is approved, Gemini will execute it. This ensures we're always in sync and building with a shared vision.
4.  **Commit Changes:** After the changes are made, Gemini will keep track of the modified files and prompt to either commit the changes or wait for more changes.

## Summary

This project is a terminal-based, open-world, automotive RPG survival game. Players select a starting vehicle and embark on an adventure in an infinitely-generated, random world. The map features roads connecting cities, surrounded by various types of wilderness.

### Key Gameplay Elements:
- **Infinite World:** A randomly generated world provides endless exploration.
- **Cities:** Procedurally generated with buildings like gas stations, mechanic shops, weapon shops, and a city hall for quests. Cities are populated with random NPCs.
- **Wilderness:** The areas between cities are filled with randomly generated fauna (e.g., deer, dogs) and enemies (e.g., bandits, other hostile vehicles).
- **Vehicles:** A diverse roster of cars is available, including sports cars, sedans, vans, trucks, monster trucks, motorcycles, hot rods, and SUVs. Each vehicle has unique stats for:
    -   **Durability:** How much damage it can sustain.
    -   **Speed & Acceleration:** Top speed and how quickly it reaches it.
    -   **Handling:** Turning radius and braking power.
    -   **Fuel:** Max capacity and efficiency.
    -   **Size:** The character grid size of the vehicle (e.g., a motorcycle might be 2x3, a van 12x14).
    -   **Attachment Points:** Number and type of slots for weapons or modules.
- **Customization:** Cars have attachment points for weapons, extra fuel tanks, or storage.
- **Combat & Progression:** Players gain experience and loot (money, damaged parts, ammo) by defeating enemies.
- **Resource Management:**
    -   **Durability:** Damage accumulates from combat and collisions, repaired at mechanic shops.
    -   **Fuel:** Consumed while driving, refilled at gas stations.
    -   **Ammo:** Required for weapons, purchased at weapon shops.
- **Quests:**
    -   **Town Hall:** Each cities town will offer a quest. 
    -   **Quest types:** There are 3 quest types, kill n, survive n time, kill boss
    -   **Progression:** Quests get harder the more you complete and the higher you level up
    -   **Town reputation:** Completing quests increses town reputation up to a limit of 100, the reputation is a modifier for town prices and drops for quests and enemies in the town.  
- **Shops:** (Price determined by town reputation)
    -   **GAS/fuel:** Buy gas for car and weapon here. 
    -   **Repair:** Fix car durability here. Buy new attachment points, upgrade attachment points here. 
    -   **AMMO:** Buy weapon ammo here. Buy weapons here. 
- **Weapons:** 
    -   **Attachment:** Each weapon has a attachment type needed for the weapon. They go in order of size, they can be upgraded, and weapons can attach to the size below them but never to the size above them. 
    -   **Max:** Vehicles start with a set number of attachments, and new ones can be purchased up to a limit. 
    -   **Scaling:** Shops will carry weapons with modifiers based on level and town reputation, adding a scaling element to the game. 

## Stack

- **Language:** Python
- **Engine:** Custom-built terminal game engine using the `curses` library.
- **Renderer:** `curses` library for all screen drawing.
- **Audio:** PyGame and fluidsynth for midi sounds, all souynds are done with midi, ch 10 for sound effects. 

## Architecture

The game is built around a central game loop in `car/game.py`. This loop handles user input, updates the game state, and renders the world.

- **Game Loop & UI:**
    -   **Main Game Loop:** The core loop in `main_game` function within `car/game.py` renders the world, including the environment, roads, buildings, and all entities. It also handles user input and updates the game state.
    -   **UI Menus:** The game features several UI menus, each in its own file in the `car/ui` directory.
        -   **Main Menu:** `car/ui/main_menu.py` - The initial screen with "New Game," "Load Game," and "Quit" options.
        -   **New Game Menu:** `car/ui/new_game.py` - Allows the player to select their car, color, difficulty, and initial weapon.
        -   **Load Game Menu:** `car/ui/load_game.py` - Displays a list of saved games to load.
        -   **Inventory Menu (Tab):** `car/ui/inventory.py` - Pressing `Tab` opens a full-screen modal with a border.
            -   **Car Preview:** Displays the player's car, rotating through 8 directions.
            -   **Attachments:** A container lists attachment points, their type, and the equipped item. Arrow keys are used to navigate and select different weapons/items from inventory.
            -   **Inventory:** A container for stored items. Selecting an item opens a pop-up with actions (e.g., "Drop").
            -   **Stats:** A container shows current fuel, ammo, money, etc.
            -   Pressing `Tab` again closes the menu.
        -   **Pause Menu (Esc):** `car/ui/pause_menu.py` - Pressing `Esc` opens a smaller modal with options: "Resume", "Save Game", "Main Menu", and "Quit".
        -   **Shop Menu:** `car/ui/shop.py` - Opens when the player is in a shop, allowing them to buy and sell items.
- **Game State Management:**
    - **Main Menu:** The game starts with a menu offering "New Game," "Load Game," and "Settings."
    - **New Game Flow:** After selecting "New Game," the player chooses a car and difficulty, then enters the main game loop.
    - **Load Game Flow:** After selecting "Load Game," the player chooses a save file from a list, which loads the state and enters the main game loop.
    - **Save/Load System:** `car/logic/save_load.py` - A system for serializing and deserializing the entire game state (player, car, world seed, inventory, quests) to a file using `pickle`.
- **Progression System:**
    - **Experience & Leveling:** Players gain experience points (XP) for defeating enemies. Upon reaching a certain XP threshold, the player levels up, receiving minor positive modifiers to their stats.
    - **XP Curve:** The experience required to reach the next level doubles with each level gained.
    - **Difficulty Modifier:** The selected difficulty level applies a multiplier to enemy stats, such as damage and durability, making the game more or less challenging.
- **Rendering Engine:**
    - **Renderer:** Utilizes the `curses` library for all screen drawing.
    - **Entities:** All game objects (cars, weapons, buildings, etc.) are represented as entities. Each entity type is defined in a configuration file in the `car/data` directory.
    - **Visuals:** Each entity's file contains a method to retrieve its ASCII/Unicode representation. This method accepts a direction parameter (8 directions: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) to return the correct directional sprite.
    - **Composition:** The rendering system dynamically composes entities with their attachments. For example, a car entity will be rendered with its attached weapon entities, positioned correctly based on the car's current direction. The weapons themselves have 8-directional art.
- **World Generation:**
    - **World Class:** `car/world/world.py` - The `World` class manages the game world, including generating and storing the world map.
    - **Procedural Generation:** `car/world/generation.py` - Procedural generation for terrain, roads, and cities.
- **Car Simulation:**
    - **Physics:** The game loop in `car/game.py` handles the physics and state management for vehicle mechanics.
- **Inventory/Attachments:**
    - **Inventory:** The player's inventory is managed in the game loop.
    - **Attachments:** The `car/ui/inventory.py` menu allows the player to manage car modifications.
- **Entity Component System (ECS-like):** The game is built on a class-based entity architecture. All game objects (vehicles, enemies, NPCs, etc.) are instances of classes that inherit from a base `Entity` class. This provides a clean, object-oriented, and highly extensible framework for adding new content.
        - **`car/entities/base.py`:** Defines the abstract `Entity` class with common properties (`position`, `health`) and methods (`update`, `draw`).
        - **`car/entities/`:** This directory contains subdirectories for each major entity type (`vehicles`, `characters`, `projectiles`).
            - **Vehicles (`car/entities/vehicles/`):** Contains classes for all drivable entities.
                - `PlayerCar`: Handles player input.
                - `EnemyCar`: Contains the phase-based AI logic for hostile vehicles.
            - **Characters (`car/entities/characters/`):** For on-foot entities.
                - `Bandit`: A simple melee enemy with its own AI.
                - `NPC`: For non-hostile characters.
    - **Spawning and Management:**
        - **Entity Registry:** A central registry will map entity type names (e.g., "bandit") to their corresponding classes.
        - **Spawning Logic (`car/logic/spawning.py`):** A dedicated module will handle the logic for when and where to spawn new entities, creating new instances of the appropriate classes and adding them to the `GameState`.
        - **Game State:** The `GameState` object now holds lists of active entity *objects*, not raw data.
    - **Main Loop:** The main game loop in `car/game.py` is now significantly simplified. It iterates through the master list of entities and calls their `update()` and `draw()` methods, delegating all logic to the entities themselves.
- **Adding New Entities:** To add a new entity (e.g., a new car or enemy), follow these steps:
    1.  **Create a new Python file** in the appropriate subdirectory of `car/entities/`. For example, a new car would go in `car/entities/vehicles/`. The filename should be the snake_case version of the entity's name (e.g., `my_new_car.py`).
    2.  **Define a new class** in this file that inherits from the appropriate base class (e.g., `PlayerCar` for a new player vehicle, `Vehicle` for an enemy vehicle, or `Character` for an on-foot character).
    3.  **Implement the necessary attributes** for the class, such as `art`, `durability`, `speed`, etc.
    4.  **Add the new entity's name** to the appropriate list in `car/logic/spawning.py` (`ENEMIES` or `FAUNA`). For player cars, add the filename to the `CARS_DATA` list in `car/data/cars.py`. The spawning system will automatically pick up the new entity.
- **AI and Phase System:**
    - **Core Design:** The AI for enemies and bosses is built on a phase-based state machine. Each entity has a `current_phase` that dictates its behavior and a `phase_timer` that determines when to transition to a new phase. This allows for dynamic and varied combat encounters.
    - **Shared Behaviors (`car/logic/ai_behaviors.py`):** Common AI movement patterns (e.g., `_execute_chase_behavior`, `_execute_strafe_behavior`) are centralized in this file. This avoids code duplication and allows for easy reuse across different entity types.
    - **Data Structure:** AI phases are defined directly in the entity's class definition (e.g., `car/entities/characters/bandit.py`). Each entity has a list of possible phases, and each phase defines its duration, behavior, and a weighted list of possible next phases.
    - **Execution Flow:** The main AI update loop in `car/logic/physics.py` is responsible for:
        1.  Initializing an entity's AI state upon spawning (setting the initial phase and timer).
        2.  Decrementing the `phase_timer` each frame.
        3.  When the timer expires, selecting a new phase based on the defined probabilities and resetting the timer.
        4.  Calling the appropriate behavior function (e.g., `_behavior_chase`, `_behavior_strafe`) based on the entity's current phase.
- **Python Package Conventions (`__init__.py`):** To keep the code clean and imports logical, we use `__init__.py` files to define the public API of a package. If you create a function in `my_package/my_module.py` that needs to be accessible elsewhere, you should import it into `my_package/__init__.py` like so: `from .my_module import my_function`. This allows other parts of the code to import it directly with `from my_package import my_function`, which is cleaner than `from my_package.my_module import my_function`.
- **Relative Imports:** When importing between modules inside the `car` package, use relative imports. The number of leading dots corresponds to the number of directories you need to go up. For example, from `car/entities/vehicles/player_car.py` to get to `car/rendering/draw_utils.py`, you need to go up three levels (`...`) to the `car` directory, then down into `rendering`. From `car/entities/obstacle.py`, you only need to go up two levels (`..`).
- **Combat System:**
    - **Damage:** The game loop in `car/game.py` manages damage, experience, and loot drops.
- **Quest System:** `car/logic/quests.py` - The `Quest` class and `QUESTS` dictionary define the quests in the game. The game loop in `car/game.py` tracks player quests and objectives. When a player accepts a quest, a boss is spawned. The player can then track the boss using a compass on the UI. When the player is near the boss, a persistent modal appears with the boss's name. When the boss is defeated, the player receives a reward and the quest is completed.
- **Economy:**
    - **Shops:** `car/data/shops.py` - The `SHOP_DATA` dictionary defines the shops in the game. The game loop in `car/game.py` handles currency and transactions at shops.
- **Cutscenes & Modals:**
    - **`car/ui/cutscene.py`:** Manages **blocking, full-screen cinematic events**. This module is responsible for scenes that take over the entire screen and pause gameplay, such as the "Game Over" sequence or future narrative events.
    - **`car/ui/entity_modal.py`:** Handles the **persistent, non-blocking entity display**. This is a core HUD element that dynamically shows information about the closest enemy or boss during live gameplay. It also contains the logic for playing entity-specific animations, like explosions, within its modal window, ensuring that all aspects of an entity's dynamic visualization are handled in one place.

- **Faction and Reputation System:** The game features a dynamic faction and reputation system that influences gameplay and world state.
    - **Hub Cities and Factions:** The world is anchored by a few non-procedural **Hub Cities**, each serving as the capital for a specific **Faction**. The rest of the world is procedurally generated, with territory control determined by proximity to the nearest Hub City.
    - **Reputation:** The player's reputation with each faction is tracked in the `GameState`. Reputation is gained by completing quests for a faction and lost by completing quests against them or attacking their units.
    - **Dynamic Quests:** Quests are dynamically generated based on faction relationships. Faction leaders in Hub Cities offer quests that target their rivals, creating a system of conflict and consequence.
    - **Faction-Based Spawning:** Enemy spawn rates and types are determined by the player's location and their reputation with the controlling faction. Allied territory is safer, while hostile territory is more dangerous and populated with that faction's specific units.
    - **Territory Control:** If a player's actions cause a faction's reputation to drop to zero, the faction with the highest player reputation will take over the defeated faction's Hub City, altering the game world.
    - **Win/Loss Conditions:** The game has clear win/loss states based on the faction system. A player can win by helping their chosen faction achieve total domination or lose by becoming an enemy to all factions.

        - [ ] You can try to run, failing quest if in a quest, but otherwise surviving. 
- [ ] Faction boss
    - [ ] You can fight the faction leader for massive faction score for winning or losing. This is an epic boss and is actually needed to take over a faction once it's at 0 rep. Each faction has a different faction boss with immense stats. 
    - [ ] If you challenge them before their rep is 0, it's stats will be even more increased. But it will have a massive rep gain or loss, and if it brings it to 0 you still need to fight him he will just have less stats for the final fight like normal.  
- [ ] Neutral city
    - [ ] 0,0 is a neutral hub city. Quests help no faction. Shops don't have faction bonuses. This city will always be neutral and always have 0 spawn chance. 
- [ ] Add shop keeper dialog, they will say something when we get in the shop. This is shop and faction specific and dynamically generated. 
    - [ ] When buying or selling high modifier equipment the shop keeper will make a comment, different comments based on the modifier. 
    - [ ] When you try to buy something without enough money, shop keeper makes a wise crack

## Roadmap

## Known Issues

- **Curses/Terminal Errors:** The game may crash on startup with a `curses` error (e.g., `nocbreak() returned ERR`). This is often due to an incompatible terminal environment or the terminal window being too small. This is a known issue with the `curses` library and the environment in which the game is being run. **Gemini, do not attempt to fix this error.** It is an environmental issue, not a code issue.
